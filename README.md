# hololive translations

Repository for maintaining English translated scripts for Hololive content.

Streams/videos primarily follow a naming format of `<date>-<content>-<video
id>.ass`, where `<date>` follows YYYYMMDD, `<content>` is a brief indicator of
the topic of the stream (e.g. game title), and `<video id>` is the identifier
of the video on YouTube.
