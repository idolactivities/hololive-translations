<p t="89730" d="2469" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">Urgent news flash!​</p>
<p t="92199" d="5773" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">We inform the public with deep regret that​</p>
<p t="97972" d="2436" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">Kiryu Coco has lost her livestreaming rights.​</p>
<p t="100408" d="3637" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">Believe it or not, Kiryu Coco has become​</p>
<p t="104045" d="5839" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">unable to livestream on her own channel, says our report.​</p>
<p t="109884" d="3770" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">This... isn&#39;t good at all!​</p>
<p t="113654" d="6472" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">And that&#39;s why no one can make a ruckus above my head now.​</p>

<p t="127268" d="6339" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">Kiryu Coco has lost her livestreaming rights.​</p>
<p t="133607" d="4271" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">Because of that, I&#39;m doing this in video form.​</p>
<p t="137878" d="3871" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">But this situation really is unbelievable.​</p>
<p t="141749" d="6707" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">Some people may not know, so I&#39;ll explain what transpired.​</p>
<p t="148456" d="5671" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">Actually... This here. This one.​</p>
<p t="154595" d="633" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">This one.​</p>
<p t="158065" d="933" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">This one.​</p>
<p t="159834" d="2768" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">Let&#39;s remove this and...​</p>
<p t="163204" d="966" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">There! Huh?​</p>
<p t="169977" d="2202" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">Ah, this one. My apologies.​</p>
<p t="172179" d="4238" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">I&#39;m doing this all in one take, stuff like this happens sometimes.​</p>
<p t="176417" d="2202" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">Anyway, getting to the explanation,​</p>
<p t="178619" d="8642" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">I had a free chat stream planned for the night of April 18th.​</p>
<p t="187261" d="6406" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">Just a normal stream I had planned for the 18th.​</p>
<p t="193667" d="3769" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">This was just your usual chat stream.​</p>
<p t="197905" d="2768" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">&quot;How to love people messed up in the head.&quot;​</p>
<p t="201742" d="4638" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">Just a straightforward, normal chatting stream.​</p>
<p t="206380" d="6372" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">I was planning on starting it at 10pm, but, to my surprise...​</p>
<p t="213154" d="5705" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">More than an hour before it was supposed
to start, the placeholder was removed.​</p>
<p t="218859" d="3070" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">Roughly an hour and ten minutes before, I think,​</p>
<p t="221929" d="4236" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">it suddenly got removed.​</p>
<p t="226767" d="3068" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">What possibly could have happened?​</p>
<p t="230304" d="6874" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">Something seemed off, so if I had to say
what it could have been, it was a wrongful takedown.​</p>
<p t="237178" d="1666" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">Why do I think so, you ask?​</p>
<p t="239680" d="3203" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">This announcement from Google.​</p>
<p t="242883" d="3304" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">From Google, or from YouTube,​</p>
<p t="246187" d="7640" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">this particular excerpt from Google&#39;s
company announcements regarding this period.​</p>
<p t="253827" d="5005" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">&quot;We&#39;ve always used a combination of humans and machines
to review content on our platforms, like YouTube.​</p>
<p t="258832" d="4438" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">&quot;We will temporarily be increasing
our reliance on automated systems...&quot;​</p>
<p t="263270" d="8409" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">In short, they&#39;re saying that since it&#39;s risky
to not leave their employees at home,​</p>
<p t="271679" d="8675" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">they&#39;ll rely on machines, on the YouTube AI,
more than ever before.​</p>
<p t="280354" d="3570" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">And due to this reliance on the YouTube AI,​</p>
<p t="283924" d="8075" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">wrongful takedowns have been occurring
not only to me, but to many other channels too.​</p>
<p t="291999" d="2269" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">In other words...​</p>
<p t="294268" d="2836" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">There&#39;s nothing we can do about these takedowns.​</p>
<p t="297104" d="4436" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">So I brushed this off as &quot;just another mistake&quot;.​</p>
<p t="302009" d="3470" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">&quot;Guess I&#39;ll just schedule it again&quot;, I thought.​</p>
<p t="305479" d="4937" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">I proceeded to try and make another stream, but...​</p>
<p t="311752" d="7441" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">when I did, this screen, one I&#39;d never seen before, showed up.​</p>
<p t="319193" d="8175" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">And it was when I saw this that I realized
I lost my livestreaming rights.​</p>
<p t="327368" d="4771" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">I had never seen this screen before.​</p>
<p t="332139" d="2269" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">This... is pretty bad, isn&#39;t it?​</p>
<p t="334408" d="2669" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">I obviously appealed it.​</p>
<p t="337077" d="4972" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">Which is like going &quot;The machines took it down,
but that was a mistake.​</p>
<p t="342049" d="4538" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">Could I have a human look at it
and confirm if it was a mistake or not?​</p>
<p t="346587" d="3704" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">Your machines have gone crazy.&quot;​</p>
<p t="350291" d="7140" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">And soon after I appealed it,
the stream I had scheduled was back up.​</p>
<p t="357431" d="1435" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">It was restored right away.​</p>
<p t="358866" d="6640" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">And what we can learn from this, is that this stream,
&quot;How to love someone messed up in the head&quot;​</p>
<p t="365506" d="5639" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">had no problems on its thumbnail or title.​</p>
<p t="371145" d="5438" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">It was a wrongful takedown. The monetization
was up too, so there&#39;s nothing wrong with it.​</p>
<p t="376583" d="4472" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">This scheduled stream came back right away. However!​</p>
<p t="381055" d="3203" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">Even though they restored the stream,​</p>
<p t="384258" d="6638" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">they didn&#39;t restore my livestreaming rights!​</p>
<p t="391432" d="2669" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">This is terrible, don&#39;t you think?​</p>
<p t="394101" d="6639" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">The scheduled stream came back, but I still couldn&#39;t livestream.​</p>
<p t="401241" d="3069" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">I had no choice but to delete it.​</p>
<p t="406280" d="3203" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">I can&#39;t understand why this happened.​</p>
<p t="409483" d="2169" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">Could the reason have been something else?​</p>
<p t="411652" d="3302" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">I tried coming up with some possible causes.​</p>
<p t="415522" d="5739" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">But I can&#39;t figure it out. It&#39;s pretty baffling.​</p>
<p t="421261" d="2468" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">And now for the expert opinion,​</p>
<p t="423397" d="52352" wp="3" ws="1" p="6">&quot;Raised middle fingers have passed multiple times.
Avoided &#39;religion&#39; in the description and thumbnail.&quot;​</p>
<p t="424531" d="1569" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">It could have been the middle fingers.​</p>
<p t="426100" d="2902" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">But I often have them raised​</p>
<p t="429002" d="3537" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">and I got an OK on previous evaluations,​</p>
<p t="432539" d="3270" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">so middle fingers are not the problem.​</p>
<p t="435809" d="6774" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">Some viewers said that maybe bringing up
religion could have been the reason.​</p>
<p t="442583" d="10809" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">But I actually thought it could be bad to use the
word &quot;religion&quot; there, so I didn&#39;t write it at all.​</p>
<p t="453961" d="7841" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">It wasn&#39;t in the description nor in the thumbnail,
so that also shouldn&#39;t be a cause.​</p>
<p t="461802" d="2636" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">To begin with, I didn&#39;t even stream it.​</p>
<p t="464438" d="6972" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">Anyway, with all that said,
I still have no idea why it happened.​</p>
<p t="472312" d="3169" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">But if there was a better reason
other than &quot;wrongful takedown&quot;,​</p>
<p t="475749" d="44211" wp="4" ws="1" p="5">Theory: YouTube AI hates Morning Coco​</p>
<p t="477017" d="5873" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">then it&#39;s gotta be this. The AI might be a hater, it has to be.​</p>
<p t="482890" d="5372" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">It probably hates Morning Coco Live and Kiryu Coco as well.​</p>
<p t="488262" d="2169" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">There are plenty of haters out there.​</p>
<p t="490431" d="6339" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">It takes plenty of energy to hate someone.​</p>
<p t="496770" d="7708" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">And considering the AI, and you haters, are spending
all that energy on me, don&#39;t you actually like me?​</p>
<p t="504478" d="3837" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">Well, some people theorize that it&#39;s like that, at least.​</p>
<p t="508315" d="6373" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">But what I&#39;m actually worried about, it&#39;s what
the people around town have to say...​</p>
<p t="514688" d="6607" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">The townspeople are... getting a little wild.​</p>

<p t="824765" d="5038" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">are in a state of deep confusion right now.​</p>

<p t="904110" d="5404" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">It&#39;s really lonely without everyone&#39;s comments.

<p t="919926" d="6106" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">And uhh, I posted the 300,000 subs milestone on Twitter,​</p>
<p t="926032" d="7007" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">and the one thing I was worried about when I posted it​</p>
<p t="933039" d="7139" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">was that a certain ubiquitous

<p t="950857" d="10944" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">I wrote a stern warning against the congratulations
spambot below the milestone tweet saying,​</p>

<p t="965138" d="2603" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">firmly refusing their presence.​</p>

<p t="987193" d="3938" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">As we suspected, YAGOO is a spambot.​</p>
<p t="991131" d="4337" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">We have proved that YAGOO really is a spambot.​</p>
<p t="995468" d="4805" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">If he were a person, he would have read and heeded the warning​</p>
<p t="1000273" d="4672" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">like any normal person would.​</p>
<p t="1004945" d="4770" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">But he couldn&#39;t do it since he&#39;s a spambot.​</p>
<p t="1010083" d="2870" wp="1" ws="1" p="1">This spambot will never stop congratulating.​</p>
